= [2023-07-15] `InputRange <...>`

`InputRange <...>` and all code based on it has been deprecated.
The main reason is that `std::basic_istream <...>` already has all the features needed and even more.
For example, `std::basic_istream <...>` has `putback`,
which I had not foreseen for `InputRange <...>` (probably requiring the Strategy design pattern), but which I have found out to be needed.

`InputRange <...>` used to be a model of the Iterator design pattern,
similar to ranges in the D programming language and to ranges in Boost and newer versions of STL
in that a range object holds two iterators,
but different in that `InputRange <...>` is a base class and `InputRange <...>`-derived objects are meant to be used polymorphically.

`std::basic_istream <...>` already used the Strategy design pattern.
The `std::basic_streambuf <...>` is the base of the hierarchy of objects used to implement `std::basic_istream <...>` functionality.
