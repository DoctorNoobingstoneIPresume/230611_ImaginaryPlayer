Example of Worker Threads and Message Passing (as opposed to lower-level synchronization).

== Building the Project

Bash script for the impatient:

```
set -o pipefail; readarray -t as < <(ls *.cpp | grep -Piv "_UT"); printf "%s\n" "${as[@]}"; xtimeq g++ -pthread -std="gnu++17" -g "${as[@]}" -o "Main" 2>&1 | tee "_go"
```

Alternatively, we can use the custom build system (with some hardcoding, currently):

```
Builder_sFolder="230611_MyProjectBuilder_PerlEdition"; BOOST_ROOT="." CXX="g++" CXXFLAGS="-std=gnu++17" LDFLAGS="-pthread" xtimeq perl -I "${Builder_sFolder}/" -I "${Builder_sFolder}/221227_PerlLib_02h/" "${Builder_sFolder}/Go.pl" 2>&1 | tee _go
```
